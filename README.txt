# tk-arg
#Automatically generate a tkinter gui from an argparse script

Use typical python install
python setup.py install
(add sudo at the start of the line if necessary)

Try the example script:
tkgui.py examples/pass_me_to_tkgui.py

Any python script using argparse can be passed to tkgui.py.  
It will pull information about the arguments out of the instantiated ArgumentParser and open a basic tkinter gui. 
Depending on how they were specified to the ArgumentParser, arguments are changed to checkboxes, string entries, radio buttons or dropdowns in the gui. After the gui has been interacted with and closed it passes information on the state to the script, 
such that the wrapped script thinks that arguments were passed on the command line.

The tk-arg package may also be called directly from client code.  This allows the specification of callbacks and dependecies between settings, such that some options are greyed out until others are entered.

Documentation is currently lacking, but I'd love to hear from anyone interested in using or test it at zwickl@email.arizona.edu.  
There is room for improvement.
